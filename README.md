2. Round Robin with a quantum value of 2
3. Last Come First Serve
4. Highest Penalty Ratio Next

Run with `java Tester --verbose [inputname]` for a detailed version of every cycle.

Please make sure that the random-numbers file is in the same folder as the program (if using a different random-numbers).
